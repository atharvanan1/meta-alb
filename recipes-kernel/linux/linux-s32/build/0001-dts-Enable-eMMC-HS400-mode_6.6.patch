Subject: [PATCH] dts: Enable eMMC HS400 mode in case of verifiedboot and
 quickboot

Since verifiedboot support is based on Linux Kernel dtb its files,
the runtime fdt fixup mechanism from U-Boot will not work.

Hence, we statically remove the 'no-1-8-v' property which disables
eMMC HS400 mode support, in case of 'verifiedboot' and 'quick-boot'
features are both enabled.

Issue: ALB-11494
